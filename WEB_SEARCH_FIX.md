# Web Search Power-Up Fix

## Issue
When users activated the Web Search power-up and asked the bot to search the web, the bot responded that it couldn't browse the web, even though the power-up was active.

## Root Cause
Two problems were preventing web search from working:

1. **Detection Pattern Too Narrow:** The `shouldPerformWebSearch()` function only triggered on very specific keywords (current, latest, news, weather, etc.) but didn't recognize general search requests like "search the web" or "look up".

2. **Bot Not Informed:** The assistant wasn't being told it had web search capabilities, so even when results were fetched, it would still say it couldn't browse the web.

## Solution

### 1. Expanded Search Detection
Updated the search detection patterns to include explicit search requests:

**Added patterns:**
```typescript
/\b(search|google|look up|find|web|internet|online)\b/i
```

Now triggers web search for queries like:
- "Can you search the web for me?"
- "Look up current bee diseases"
- "Find information about..."
- "Search online for..."

### 2. System Context Injection
Modified the chat API to inject system instructions that inform the bot about its web search capabilities:

**When search is performed:**
```typescript
[SYSTEM]: You have web search capabilities enabled. Here are current web search results:

{search results}

[USER QUESTION]: {original question}

[INSTRUCTION]: Use the web search results above to provide an accurate, up-to-date answer.
```

**When search power-up is active but not triggered:**
```typescript
[SYSTEM]: You have web search capabilities. If the user asks for current information, let them know you can search the web.

[USER]: {message}
```

This ensures the bot knows it has web search available and can inform users about this capability.

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/lib/web-search.ts`
- Expanded `shouldPerformWebSearch()` patterns
- Now detects explicit search requests
- Added keywords: search, google, look up, find, web, internet, online

### 2. `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`
- Added system context injection when web search is active
- Informs bot about web search capabilities
- Provides clear instructions on how to use search results
- Works even when search isn't triggered (bot knows it has the capability)

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: User Asks to Search
**User:** "Can you search the web for me?"

**System:**
1. Detects "search" keyword → triggers web search
2. Performs DuckDuckGo search
3. Injects results with system instructions
4. Bot uses results to provide informed answer

### Scenario 2: User Asks for Current Info
**User:** "What's the latest news about beekeeping?"

**System:**
1. Detects "latest" keyword → triggers web search
2. Fetches current information
3. Bot provides up-to-date answer with citations

### Scenario 3: General Question with Power-Up Active
**User:** "How do I manage a hive?"

**System:**
1. No search trigger keywords
2. Still informs bot it has web search capabilities
3. Bot can offer to search if more current info is needed

## Search Trigger Keywords

The system now searches when it detects:

**Explicit Requests:**
- search, google, look up, find, web, internet, online

**Time-Based:**
- current, latest, recent, today, this week, this month, 2024, 2025

**Content Types:**
- news, update, happening, weather, temperature, forecast

**Financial:**
- price, stock, crypto, bitcoin

**Sports:**
- score, game, match, won, lost

## Web Search Provider

Currently using **DuckDuckGo Instant Answer API**:
- ✅ Free (no API key required)
- ✅ Privacy-focused
- ✅ Good for general queries
- ✅ Provides summaries and related topics

**For production:** Consider upgrading to:
- Tavily AI (best for AI applications)
- SerpAPI (comprehensive results)
- Brave Search API (privacy-focused with better coverage)

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Explicit Search Request
```
User: "Can you search the web for bee diseases?"
Expected: Bot searches and provides current information
```

### Test Case 2: Current Events
```
User: "What's the latest on colony collapse disorder?"
Expected: Bot searches for recent news/updates
```

### Test Case 3: Power-Up Awareness
```
User: "Can you browse the internet?"
Expected: Bot confirms it has web search capabilities
```

### Test Case 4: Normal Question
```
User: "How do I inspect a hive?"
Expected: Bot answers from knowledge, mentions web search is available if needed
```

## Benefits

✅ **Bot is Self-Aware:** Knows when it has web search capabilities
✅ **Proactive Search:** Automatically searches for relevant queries
✅ **Transparent:** Can tell users about search capabilities
✅ **Flexible:** Works for both explicit and implicit search needs
✅ **Better UX:** Users get current information when they need it

## Future Enhancements

1. **Better Search Provider:** Integrate Tavily AI for AI-optimized results
2. **Search History:** Track what was searched for analytics
3. **Source Citations:** Format search results with clickable links
4. **Search Refinement:** Allow users to refine searches
5. **Multi-Query Search:** Perform multiple searches for complex questions

---

**Status:** ✅ Fixed and Enhanced
**Impact:** Critical - Core power-up functionality now works as expected
**User Experience:** Bot now provides current, accurate information when web search is active
