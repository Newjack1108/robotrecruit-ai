# Vimeo Video Not Showing - Privacy Settings Fix

## Problem
The Vimeo video (ID: 1128148745) is not displaying on the homepage. When accessing the video directly at https://vimeo.com/1128148745, it shows a "Verify to continue" security check page.

## Root Cause
The video likely has **privacy restrictions** that prevent it from being embedded on external websites. Vimeo videos need specific privacy settings to work with iframe embeds.

## Solution

### Step 1: Check Vimeo Video Privacy Settings

1. **Log in to Vimeo**: https://vimeo.com
2. **Go to your video**: https://vimeo.com/1128148745/settings
3. **Navigate to "Privacy" tab**

### Step 2: Required Privacy Settings

For the video to embed properly, configure these settings:

#### **Privacy Settings:**
- **Who can watch**: Set to **"Anyone"** or **"Only people with the private link"**
  - ⚠️ **DO NOT** use "Only me" - this blocks all embedding
  - ⚠️ **DO NOT** use "People I follow" - this requires authentication

#### **Embedding Settings:**
- **Where can this be embedded**: Set to **"Anywhere"**
  - ✅ This allows the video to be embedded on your website
  - Alternative: **"Specific domains"** and add your domain (`robotrecruit-ai-production.up.railway.app` or your custom domain)

#### **Domain-Level Privacy:**
Under "Embed privacy":
- ✅ **Enable**: "Let people embed this video anywhere"
- OR
- ⚠️ **Whitelist your domain**: Add `robotrecruit-ai-production.up.railway.app`

### Step 3: Additional Recommended Settings

#### **Interaction Tools:**
- ✅ Enable: "Allow users to add your video to their Watch Later queue"
- ✅ Enable: "Allow users to share your video"

#### **Video File Access:**
- ⚠️ Disable: "Allow video file downloads" (security)

### Step 4: Apply and Test

1. **Save all changes** in Vimeo settings
2. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for Vimeo's CDN to update
3. **Hard refresh** your website (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. **Check browser console** for any remaining errors

## Alternative: Use a Different Video Host

If you prefer more control, consider these alternatives:

### Option 1: Self-Host the Video
- Upload video to your server or cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2)
- Use HTML5 `<video>` tag
- Pros: Full control, no restrictions
- Cons: Bandwidth costs, no analytics

### Option 2: Switch to YouTube
- Upload to YouTube
- Use YouTube iframe embed
- Pros: Better embedding support, fewer restrictions
- Cons: YouTube branding

### Option 3: Use Bunny.net or Mux
- Dedicated video hosting platforms
- Better embedding control
- Affordable pricing

## Testing Checklist

After updating Vimeo settings, verify:

- [ ] Video loads without "Verify to continue" message
- [ ] Video autoplays on page load (with muted audio)
- [ ] Video loops continuously
- [ ] No console errors related to iframe
- [ ] Works on both desktop and mobile
- [ ] Works on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## Current Implementation

The video is correctly implemented in the code:

```tsx
<VimeoPlayer
  videoId="1128148745"
  autoplay={true}
  muted={true}
  loop={true}
  background={true}
  className="absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-full"
  showPlayButton={false}
/>
```

The issue is **not in the code** - it's in the **Vimeo video privacy settings**.

## Quick Fix Command

If you need to replace the video immediately, update the video ID in `src/app/page.tsx`:

```bash
# Find and replace the video ID
sed -i 's/videoId="1128148745"/videoId="YOUR_NEW_VIDEO_ID"/g' src/app/page.tsx
```

## Support

If the issue persists after updating Vimeo settings:

1. **Check Vimeo Status**: https://vimeostatus.com
2. **Verify embed settings**: Try embedding the video on CodePen/JSFiddle first
3. **Contact Vimeo Support**: They can check for account-level restrictions
4. **Use Vimeo's Embed Code**: Get the official embed code from Vimeo and compare parameters

## Additional Debugging

Added console logging to the VimeoPlayer component. Check browser console for:
- `[VimeoPlayer] Video loaded successfully: 1128148745` ✅ Good
- `[VimeoPlayer] Failed to load video: 1128148745` ❌ Privacy issue

Open browser DevTools (F12) → Console tab to see these messages.
