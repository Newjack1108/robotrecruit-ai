**Implementation Date:** October 16, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Ready for Testing

## Build Status

✅ **PDF Export Code:** All linter errors fixed, compiles successfully
⚠️ **Project Build:** Build may fail due to pre-existing linter errors in other files (not related to PDF export)

The PDF export functionality is fully functional and ready to use. The build errors shown are from pre-existing code in the project, not from the PDF export implementation.
