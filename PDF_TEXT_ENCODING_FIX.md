# PDF Text Encoding Fix

## Issue
The PDF export displayed garbled text with encoding issues, showing characters like "=CÃ„onversation Report" instead of "ðŸ“„ Conversation Report".

## Root Cause
The `@react-pdf/renderer` library doesn't properly handle emoji characters and some Unicode symbols. When emojis are included in the PDF text, they get corrupted during the rendering process, causing encoding issues.

## Solution
Removed all emoji characters from the PDF content and used plain text labels instead.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Fixed Header Title
**Before:**
```tsx
<Text style={styles.headerTitle}>ðŸ“„ Conversation Report</Text>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<Text style={styles.headerTitle}>Conversation Report</Text>
```

#### 2. Fixed Message Sender Names
**Before:**
```tsx
const senderName = isUser ? 'ðŸ‘¤ User' : `ðŸ¤– ${conversation.bot.name}`;
```

**After:**
```tsx
const senderName = isUser ? 'User' : conversation.bot.name;
```

## Benefits

âœ… **Clean Text:** No more garbled characters or encoding issues
âœ… **Professional Look:** Plain text is more appropriate for PDF documents
âœ… **Universal Compatibility:** Works across all PDF readers and platforms
âœ… **Better Printing:** Text prints correctly without special character issues
âœ… **Accessibility:** Screen readers can properly read the text

## Visual Changes

### Header
- **Before:** "ðŸ“„ Conversation Report" â†’ Displayed as "=CÃ„onversation Report"
- **After:** "Conversation Report" â†’ Displays correctly

### Message Senders
- **Before:** "ðŸ‘¤ User" â†’ Could show as garbled text
- **After:** "User" â†’ Clean, clear text
- **Before:** "ðŸ¤– Boss Bot" â†’ Could show as garbled text  
- **After:** "Boss Bot" â†’ Clean, clear text

## Files Modified

**`src/lib/pdf-generator.tsx`**
- Removed emoji from header title
- Removed emojis from sender names
- Kept all other formatting and styling intact

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Go to `/chat` and have a conversation
2. Activate the Data Export power-up
3. Click "EXPORT PDF"
4. Open the PDF and verify:
   - âœ… Header shows "Conversation Report" clearly
   - âœ… User messages show "User" as sender
   - âœ… Bot messages show the bot name (e.g., "Boss Bot")
   - âœ… No garbled characters or encoding issues
   - âœ… All text is readable and professional

## Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Custom Font with Emoji Support:** 
   - Could register a font that supports emojis
   - Adds complexity and file size
   - Not worth it for a few decorative emojis

2. **SVG Icons:**
   - Could use SVG icons instead of emojis
   - Adds complexity to the PDF generation
   - Overkill for this use case

3. **Plain Text (Chosen):**
   - âœ… Simplest and most reliable
   - âœ… Professional appearance
   - âœ… No dependencies or extra setup
   - âœ… Works everywhere

## Color Coding Preserved

The visual distinction between user and bot messages is still maintained through:
- **Background colors:** Blue for user, purple for bot
- **Border colors:** Different colored left borders
- **Message positioning:** Different layouts
- **Text styling:** Clean, readable fonts

Users can still easily distinguish between user and bot messages without needing emojis.
