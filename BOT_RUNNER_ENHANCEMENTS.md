# Bot Runner Game Enhancements - Complete! 🎮✨

## Overview
Major improvements to the Bot Runner arcade game including bug fixes, retro sound effects, and professional visual polish.

---

## 🐛 Core Bug Fixes

### 1. Fixed Bug Pathfinding (Wall Clipping)
**File:** `src/lib/bot-runner-ai.ts`

**Problem:** Bugs were walking through walls due to:
- No prevention of 180° direction reversals
- Invalid wrapped positions not being validated

**Solution:**
- Added `previousDirection` parameter to prevent backtracking
- Filter neighbors to exclude reverse direction unless forced
- Validate wrapped positions before returning
- Ensure final move is actually reachable

**Result:** Bugs now stay within maze paths with smooth, predictable movement

### 2. Fixed Collision Detection (Power-Up Eating)
**Files:** `src/lib/bot-runner-engine.ts`

**Problem:** Collision only checked exact tile positions, missing bugs during smooth movement

**Solution:**
- Changed from exact position match to proximity-based detection
- Calculate distance between visual positions
- Collision triggers when within 0.5 tiles
- Formula: `distance = sqrt(dx² + dy²) < 0.5`

**Result:** Can now eat powered-up bugs immediately on contact

## 🔊 Sound System

### File Created: `src/lib/bot-runner-sounds.ts`

**Technology:** Web Audio API (no sound files needed!)

**Sounds Implemented:**
- **Task Collect** - Short blip (800Hz, 80ms)
- **Power-Up Pickup** - Rising tone sequence (400→800Hz)
- **Bug Eaten** - Descending whoosh (600→100Hz)
- **Death** - Falling chromatic scale (600→350Hz)
- **Game Start** - Quick startup jingle
- **Game Over** - Victory fanfare or sad trombone
- **Power-Up Warning** - Alert beep at 2 seconds remaining

**Features:**
- Retro arcade style tones
- Master volume control
- Lazy audio context initialization
- Auto-resume on user interaction

- **Trail effects** - Behind powered-up player
- Physics simulation with gravity

**Features:**
- Configurable colors, sizes, life spans
- Multiple particle types (circle, star, square)
- Smooth fade-out and rotation

- **+200** - Bugs (purple, explodes outward)
- **Combo multipliers** - (orange, pulses)

**Animations:**
- Type-specific movement patterns
- Scale and opacity transitions
- Color-coded by event type
- Auto-cleanup after animation

### 3. Screen Effects
**File Created:** `src/components/arcade/ScreenEffects.tsx`
