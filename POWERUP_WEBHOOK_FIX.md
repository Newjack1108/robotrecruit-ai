# Power-Up Credits Not Showing - Webhook Fix

## Problem
Purchased power-up credits but they're not appearing in the account.

## Root Cause
The power-up purchase webhook (`/api/stripe/webhook-powerup`) requires a **separate webhook secret** (`STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_POWERUP`) that isn't configured in Railway yet.

## Immediate Fix (Manual Credit)

First, let's manually credit your account while we fix the webhook:

```bash
# Run this locally (replace with your email):
npx tsx scripts/manual-credit-powerups.ts your-email@example.com 10

# Or on Railway:
railway run npx tsx scripts/manual-credit-powerups.ts your-email@example.com 10
```

## Permanent Fix (Configure Webhook)

### Step 1: Create Power-Up Webhook in Stripe

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Click **"+ Add endpoint"**
3. Enter webhook URL:
   ```
   https://robotrecruit-ai-production.up.railway.app/api/stripe/webhook-powerup
   ```
   (Replace with your actual Railway domain)

4. Select **only this event**:
   - âœ… `checkout.session.completed`

5. Click **"Add endpoint"**

6. **Copy the Signing Secret** (starts with `whsec_...`)

### Step 2: Add Environment Variable to Railway

1. Go to Railway Dashboard â†’ Your Project â†’ Variables
2. Click **"+ New Variable"**
3. Add:
   ```
   Name: STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_POWERUP
   Value: whsec_YOUR_SIGNING_SECRET_HERE
   ```
4. Click **"Save"**
5. Railway will automatically redeploy

### Step 3: Verify Webhook Works

1. Make a test purchase (use Stripe test card if in test mode: `4242 4242 4242 4242`)
2. Check Stripe Dashboard â†’ Webhooks â†’ Your endpoint
3. You should see webhook events being sent
4. Click on an event to see if it succeeded (200 response) or failed

### Step 4: Test on Your Account

After the webhook is configured, test by:

1. Visit `/powerups/purchase`
2. Purchase the smallest package (Â£3.99)
3. Complete checkout
4. Credits should appear within seconds
5. Check notifications - you should see "Power-Up Credits Added! ðŸŽ‰"

## Current Webhooks Status

You should have **TWO webhooks** in Stripe:

| Webhook | URL | Events | Secret Env Var |
|---------|-----|--------|----------------|
| Subscriptions | `/api/stripe/webhook` | `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.*`, `invoice.*` | `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` |
| Power-ups | `/api/stripe/webhook-powerup` | `checkout.session.completed` | `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_POWERUP` |

## Verification Script

Check your current power-up balance:

```bash
# Locally:
npx tsx scripts/check-stripe-payments.ts your-email@example.com

# On Railway:
railway run npx tsx scripts/check-stripe-payments.ts your-email@example.com
```

## If Payment Already Went Through

If Stripe already charged you but credits weren't added:

1. Check Stripe Dashboard â†’ Payments to verify the payment succeeded
2. Run the manual credit script with the number of credits from your purchase
3. Configure the webhook so future purchases work automatically

## Credit Amounts by Package

- **Starter Pack**: Â£3.99 = 10 credits
- **Pro Pack**: Â£7.99 = 25 credits  
- **Power Pack**: Â£14.99 = 60 credits
- **Ultimate Pack**: Â£24.99 = 120 credits

## Support

If you need immediate help, provide:
1. Your email address
2. Stripe payment ID (from confirmation email)
3. Package purchased
4. Timestamp of purchase

I can manually credit your account while the webhook is being configured.
