## Temporary Placeholder

Until custom assets are created, you can use existing bot images as placeholders:
- Main image: `/bots/boss-bot.png` (temporary)
- Avatar: `/bots/boss-bot-avatar.png` (temporary)

The code will use these placeholders for now.

## Asset Creation Options

1. **AI Image Generation:** Use DALL-E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion
   - Prompt: "Friendly robot character reading instruction manual, futuristic style, blue and green colors, tech theme, PNG transparent background"

2. **Hire Designer:** Fiverr, Upwork, or 99designs
   - Budget: $20-50 for both images

3. **Use Existing Assets:** Modify existing bot images if they fit the theme

4. **Icon-Based:** Use a simple icon-based approach with manual/book emoji or icon
