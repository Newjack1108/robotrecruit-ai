## 🎯 Success Metrics to Track

In Google Search Console, track:
1. **Impressions** - How often you appear in search
2. **Clicks** - How often people click your results
3. **CTR** - Click-through rate (aim for >5%)
4. **Average Position** - Your ranking (aim for top 10 = first page)
5. **Indexed Pages** - How many pages Google has indexed

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Authentication Pages**: Dashboard, chat, profile pages won't be indexed (by design - they're private)
2. **Public Pages Only**: Only these pages will appear in Google:
   - Homepage
   - Bots page (if public)
   - Subscription/pricing
   - Privacy & Terms
   - Any future blog/marketing pages

3. **Domain**: Make sure NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL matches your actual domain
