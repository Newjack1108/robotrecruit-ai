## Troubleshooting

### Chats Not Working

**Error**: "This bot is not fully configured yet"

**Error**: "Invalid assistant_id"
- **Solution**: Make sure the Assistant ID starts with `asst_` and is copied correctly from OpenAI Platform

**Error**: "401 Unauthorized"
- **Solution**: Check your `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set correctly in `.env.local`

### File Upload Issues

**Error**: "Invalid file type"

**Error**: "Failed to upload file"
- **Solution**: Check your OpenAI API key has access to Files API

### Image Upload Issues (Image Recognition Power-up)

**Error**: "Image upload service not configured"
- **Solution**: Add `IMGBB_API_KEY` to your `.env.local` file
- Get a free API key at https://api.imgbb.com/
- Restart your dev server after adding the key

**Error**: "Failed to upload to image host"
- **Solution**: Check that your imgbb API key is valid
- Verify the key is correctly set in environment variables
- Check imgbb service status if issues persist

### Promo Codes Not Working
