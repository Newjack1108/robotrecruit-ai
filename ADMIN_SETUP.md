# Admin Panel Setup Guide

## Overview
The admin panel allows you to securely manage OpenAI Assistant IDs for your bots. All assistant IDs are stored in the database and can be updated through a secure web interface.

## üîê Security Features

1. **Email-based Authentication**: Only users with emails listed in `ADMIN_EMAILS` environment variable can access the admin panel
2. **Server-side Validation**: All updates are validated on the server before being saved
3. **Masked Display**: Assistant IDs are partially masked in the UI for security
4. **API Key Protection**: Your OpenAI API key remains secure in environment variables
5. **Format Validation**: Ensures assistant IDs start with `asst_` before saving

## üìã Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Set Admin Email(s)

Add your admin email(s) to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Add this line to your .env.local
ADMIN_EMAILS=your-email@example.com,another-admin@example.com
```

**Note**: Use the same email you use to sign in with Clerk.

### Step 2: Create OpenAI Assistants

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/assistants)
2. Click "Create Assistant" for each bot
3. Configure each assistant with:
   - **Name**: (e.g., "Boss Bot", "Bee Bot", "Equi Bot")
   - **Instructions**: Detailed system prompt for the bot's role
   - **Model**: Choose `gpt-4o` or `gpt-3.5-turbo`
   - **Tools**: Enable any tools you want (Code Interpreter, File Search, etc.)
4. Copy the Assistant ID (starts with `asst_`)

#### Recommended Instructions for Each Bot:

## üîß API Endpoints

### `PATCH /api/admin/bots`

Update a bot's OpenAI Assistant ID.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "botId": "string",
  "openaiAssistantId": "asst_..."
}
```

**Security:**
- Requires authentication (Clerk)
- Validates user is admin (email in ADMIN_EMAILS)
- Validates Assistant ID format
- Server-side only (no client-side bypass)

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "Forbidden: Admin access required"
- Check that your email is in the `ADMIN_EMAILS` environment variable
- Make sure you're signed in with the correct account
- Restart your dev server after changing environment variables

### "Invalid assistant ID format"
- Assistant IDs must start with `asst_`
- Copy the full ID from OpenAI Platform
- Example: `asst_abc123xyz789`

### Chats Not Working
- Make sure you've updated all bot Assistant IDs
- Verify your `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in `.env.local`
- Check the OpenAI Assistants are active on the platform
- Look at server logs for specific errors

## üìù Database Structure

The `openaiAssistantId` field is stored in the `Bot` table:

```prisma
model Bot {
  id                String   @id @default(cuid())
  name              String
  slug              String   @unique
  openaiAssistantId String   @unique  // <- Stored here
  // ... other fields
}
```

## üîÑ Updating Assistants

When you need to change an assistant's behavior:

1. **Option 1 - Update on OpenAI Platform:**
   - Go to [OpenAI Assistants](https://platform.openai.com/assistants)
   - Edit the assistant's instructions
   - No need to update anything in your app

2. **Option 2 - Create New Assistant:**
   - Create a new assistant on OpenAI Platform
   - Copy the new Assistant ID
   - Update it in the admin panel
   - Old assistant can be deleted or kept as backup

## üí° Best Practices

1. **Keep Assistant IDs Secret**: Don't commit them to git
2. **Use Descriptive Names**: Name assistants clearly on OpenAI Platform
3. **Test Before Production**: Test assistant behavior before updating IDs
4. **Backup Configuration**: Document your assistant instructions
5. **Monitor Usage**: Check OpenAI dashboard for API usage and costs
